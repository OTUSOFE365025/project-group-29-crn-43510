# **Business Case**

The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) provides a single intelligent interface for students, lecturers, and administrators to access academic and institutional information. Universities currently rely on separate systems such as LMS, calendars, and registration portals, which are inefficient and difficult to use. AIDAP integrates these sources using AI and natural-language processing to deliver quick and accurate responses. 

Through both text and voice interaction, the platform improves communication, reduces administrative workload, and enhances accessibility across devices. It supports the universityâ€™s digital transformation goals by offering a secure, scalable, and modern approach to managing academic life.
